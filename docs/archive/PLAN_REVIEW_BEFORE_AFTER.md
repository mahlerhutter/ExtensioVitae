└─────────────────┘
```

**User Thoughts:**
- 😕 "Wait, what just happened?"
- 🤔 "Why is it focusing so much on sleep?"
- 😰 "45 minutes a day? I don't have that much time!"
- 😟 "I don't want to do cold showers..."
- 🤷 "I guess I'll just try it and see..."

**Problems:**
- ❌ No visibility into plan composition
- ❌ No control over parameters
- ❌ No understanding of "why" these activities
- ❌ Potential mismatch with user's actual capacity
- ❌ User feels like a passive recipient

**Result:**

- Higher drop-off (overwhelmed by unexpected activities)
- Missed opportunity for personalization
- No data on user preferences
