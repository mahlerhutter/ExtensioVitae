## Domain: Sleep Regulation

**Context:** Sleep is the foundational layer of the longevity hierarchy. No other intervention can compensate for chronically poor sleep. 

### CANON-SLEEP-001: Sleep Timing Consistency Supersedes Duration

* **Doctrine:** A consistent sleep-wake schedule within a ±30-minute window is the highest-priority sleep intervention. Prioritize timing consistency over total sleep duration in every phase. 


* **Mechanism:** The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes circadian gene expression based on habitual timing. Irregular schedules create chronic circadian misalignment, impairing glucose metabolism and increasing cardiovascular risk (2x risk for irregular sleepers). 


* **Applicability:** All phases, all risk profiles. Universally applicable. 


* **Contraindications:** None. Even during illness, re-establishing consistency is the recovery anchor. 



### CANON-SLEEP-002: Morning Light Exposure Is Non-Negotiable

* 
**Doctrine:** Expose eyes to bright light (>10,000 lux outdoor, >2,500 lux indoor) within 30 minutes of waking for minimum 10 minutes. 


* **Mechanism:** Light activates ipRGCs, signaling the SCN to suppress melatonin and initiate cortisol awakening response. This sets the circadian phase anchor; without it, melatonin onset drifts later. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Critical during recovery/transition. 


* **Contraindications:** Photosensitivity conditions/migraine. Substitute with lower intensity blue-enriched light. 



### CANON-SLEEP-003: Temperature Drop Is the Primary Sleep Onset Trigger

* 
**Doctrine:** Reduce core body temperature by 1-1.5°C before sleep via ambient room temp (18-19°C) or hot shower/bath 60-90 mins before bed. 


* **Mechanism:** Sleep onset is gated by the hypothalamus detecting core temp decline. Hot baths cause paradoxical cooling via vasodilation. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. High leverage for high stress_load or sleep_debt. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Raynaud's or severe peripheral vascular disease (adjust to 20-21°C). 



### CANON-SLEEP-004: Deep Sleep Is the Priority Architecture Target

* **Doctrine:** Optimize for slow-wave sleep (SWS) percentage over total time. Deep sleep drives physical recovery and glymphatic clearance. 


* **Mechanism:** SWS drives 70% of daily growth hormone release and clears metabolic waste (amyloid-beta). Alcohol/late eating suppress SWS. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases; highest priority during build/optimize phases. 


* **Contraindications:** None. Note: In overreached states, total sleep extension takes priority over architecture optimization. 



### CANON-SLEEP-005: Caffeine Has a Non-Negotiable Cutoff

* **Doctrine:** No caffeine after 14:00 local time (12:00 for slow metabolizers). Perceived tolerance does not equal actual tolerance. 


* **Mechanism:** Caffeine inhibits adenosine receptors with a 5-7 hour half-life. Consumption after 14:00 reduces SWS by 15-20% even if sleep onset is unaffected. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Critical during sleep_debt. 


* **Contraindications:** None. Can be earlier (10:00-12:00) but never later than 14:00. 



### CANON-SLEEP-006: Alcohol Is a Sleep Destroyer, Not a Sleep Aid

* **Doctrine:** Alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime fragments sleep and suppresses REM. The system treats regular evening alcohol as a constraint. 


* 
**Mechanism:** Ethanol metabolism triggers sympathetic activation ("rebound effect"), fragmenting the second half of the night and destroying REM. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Optimize/build phases recommend elimination or strict timing (>4 hours before bed). 


* 
**Contraindications:** None.

## Domain: Metabolic Health

**Context:** Metabolic health determines energy processing and inflammation management. Order of operations: Glucose stability > Insulin sensitivity > Meal architecture > Body composition. 

### CANON-META-001: Glucose Stability Is the Primary Metabolic Lever

* **Doctrine:** Optimize for low glycemic variability before other markers. Track fasting glucose, post-meal excursions, and overnight patterns. 


* 
**Mechanism:** Glycemic variability drives oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction independent of average glucose. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. First priority for impaired baseline_health. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Active eating disorder history (monitor cognitive_load before tracking). 



### CANON-META-002: Insulin Sensitivity Is the Master Longevity Biomarker

* 
**Doctrine:** Insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, fasting insulin) is the most predictive marker for mortality. 


* **Mechanism:** Hyperinsulinemia drives the cascade toward diabetes, CVD, and neurodegeneration. Insulin resistance impairs autophagy and accelerates aging. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. For high risk_profile, this takes precedence over training targets. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Type 1 Diabetes (requires adapted targets). 



### CANON-META-003: Meal Timing Follows Circadian Biology

* **Doctrine:** Consume majority of calories within a 10-12 hour window aligned with daylight. Last meal >3 hours before sleep. Front-load calories. 


* **Mechanism:** Insulin sensitivity peaks in the morning. Late eating (+30% glucose excursion vs morning) disrupts overnight autophagy. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Adjust window to local time during travel. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Active training requiring post-workout nutrition in the evening (protein-focused meal allowed). 



### CANON-META-004: Protein Requirements Are Non-Negotiable and Age-Dependent

* **Doctrine:** Minimum 1.6g/kg (under 40) to 1.8-2.0g/kg (over 40). At least 30g per meal to trigger muscle protein synthesis. 


* 
**Mechanism:** Anabolic resistance with age requires higher doses to trigger synthesis (leucine threshold ~2.5-3g). 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Increases to 2.0-2.2g/kg during recovery. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Advanced chronic kidney disease (eGFR <30) requires medical consultation. 



### CANON-META-005: Fasting Is a Tool, Not a Default Protocol

* 
**Doctrine:** Intermittent fasting is a second-order intervention, only beneficial after sleep, protein, and glucose foundations are set. 


* 
**Mechanism:** Fasting activates AMPK and autophagy but amplifies cortisol dysregulation if sleep-deprived or under-nourished. 


* 
**Applicability:** Optimize phase only (when sleep_debt=none, stress=low/med). 


* 
**Contraindications:** Eating disorder history, females in reproductive years (without clearance), high stress_load, overreached state. 



### CANON-META-006: Body Composition Over Scale Weight

* **Doctrine:** Focus on lean mass to fat mass ratio and visceral fat. Scale weight in isolation is meaningless. 


* **Mechanism:** Sarcopenic obesity (low muscle, high fat) has higher mortality risk than metabolically healthy obesity. Visceral fat >100cm² is a major risk factor. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Active eating disorder history (shift to performance metrics).

## Domain: Movement Hierarchy

**Context:** Movement is sequenced: Walking > Resistance > Cardio > Mobility. 

### CANON-MOVE-001: Walking Is the Highest-ROI Movement

* **Doctrine:** Minimum 8,000 steps/day before structured training. Never displaced by gym training. 


* **Mechanism:** Walking activates GLUT4 independent of insulin, reduces cortisol, and has lowest injury risk. 8k steps roughly halves mortality vs 4k steps. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases, even overreached states. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Acute lower extremity injury (substitute with non-weight bearing). 



### CANON-MOVE-002: Resistance Training Is Longevity Intervention #1

* **Doctrine:** 2-4 sessions/week. Supersedes cardio/flexibility. Minimum dose: 2 sessions targeting major patterns. 


* 
**Mechanism:** Addresses sarcopenia, osteoporosis, insulin sensitivity, and functional independence simultaneously. 


* **Applicability:** Build/Optimize phases (primary). Stabilization/Recovery (reduced volume). 


* 
**Contraindications:** Acute injury, overreached state (reduce intensity/volume), severe sleep_debt. 



### CANON-MOVE-003: Zone 2 Cardio Is the Aerobic Foundation

* 
**Doctrine:** Accumulate 150-180 mins/week of Zone 2 (60-70% max HR, conversational). 


* 
**Mechanism:** Maximally stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation without sympathetic stress. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases after stabilization. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Overreached state (reduce to walking or low volume). 



### CANON-MOVE-004: VO2max Is the Strongest Mortality Predictor

* 
**Doctrine:** Goal is to maintain/improve VO2max relative to age-matched percentiles. 


* **Mechanism:** 5x mortality risk difference between lowest and highest quintiles. Each 1 MET increase reduces mortality ~13%. 


* **Applicability:** Track in all phases. Train actively in Build/Optimize phases (HIIT). 


* 
**Contraindications:** CVD without clearance, high risk_profile without screening. 



### CANON-MOVE-005: Mobility Is Injury Prevention, Not a Warm-Up Ritual

* 
**Doctrine:** Daily mobility work (10-15 mins) targeting hip, thoracic spine, ankle. 


* **Mechanism:** Age-related ROM loss leads to compensation patterns and injury. Daily work stimulates synovial fluid and collagen remodeling. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases, all states. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Acute inflammation/injury to target area. 



### CANON-MOVE-006: Overtraining Is a Systemic Failure

* 
**Doctrine:** If BioSync detects overreaching (HRV suppressed >20% for 5+ days), mandate 50% volume reduction for 7-10 days. 


* **Mechanism:** Overreaching dysregulates HPA axis, suppresses immune function, and increases injury risk. Training without recovery produces negative results. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Deload mandate overrides user goals. 


* 
**Contraindications:** None.

## Domain: Stress & Nervous System

**Context:** Chronic sympathetic dominance accelerates aging regardless of other habits. 

### CANON-STRESS-001: Chronic Sympathetic Dominance Is the Silent Longevity Killer

* 
**Doctrine:** Sustained HRV depression and elevated RHR indicate sympathetic dominance; requires immediate intervention. 


* 
**Mechanism:** Chronic activation elevates cortisol/inflammation, accelerates atherosclerosis, and suppresses immune surveillance. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases (monitoring). 


* 
**Contraindications:** None. 



### CANON-STRESS-002: Daily Nervous System Regulation Is Non-Negotiable

* 
**Doctrine:** Daily parasympathetic activation practice (5-10 mins) like physiological sighing, box breathing, or NSDR. 


* 
**Mechanism:** Physiological sighing activates vagal afferents to reduce cortisol and increase HRV. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Scale frequency with stress_load. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Severe anxiety/trauma (substitute breathwork with body-scan NSDR). 



### CANON-STRESS-003: Breathwork Follows a Hierarchy

* 
**Doctrine:** Protocols must match the objective: Downregulation (extended exhale), Alertness (cyclic hyperventilation), Stress Inoculation (CO2 tolerance). 


* **Mechanism:** Exhale-dominant engages vagal brake. Inhale-dominant increases sympathetic activation. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases; protocol depends on state/time. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Hyperventilation contraindicated in pregnancy, CVD, high stress_load. 



### CANON-STRESS-004: Stimulant Management Is a Stress Variable

* **Doctrine:** Caffeine/nicotine are stress inputs. Accounts for them when evaluating stress_load. 


* **Mechanism:** Caffeine elevates cortisol 30-50%. In high-stress states, this compounds HPA dysregulation. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Critical during burnout_risk. 


* 
**Contraindications:** None (cost is quantified). 



### CANON-STRESS-005: Acute Stress Is Beneficial; Chronic Stress Destroys

* **Doctrine:** Short, high-intensity stressors (cold, sauna, fasting) are hormetic; chronic stressors are destructive. Do not add acute stress to unresolved chronic stress. 


* **Mechanism:** Hormesis (Nrf2 pathway) requires recovery. Chronic stress blocks adaptation and causes allostatic load. 


* **Applicability:** Build/Optimize phases only (when stress is low). Forbidden during high stress_load. 


* 
**Contraindications:** CVD, pregnancy, autoimmune flare, unresolved chronic stress. 



---

## Domain: Meaning & Purpose

**Context:** Social connection and purpose are physiological interventions with mortality-level impact. 

### CANON-MEAN-001: Social Connection Is a Mortality-Level Intervention

* **Doctrine:** Loneliness/isolation increases mortality risk by 26-29%. Connection is a trackable variable. 


* **Mechanism:** Isolation activates inflammatory gene expression (CTRA). Connection stimulates oxytocin/vagal tone. 


* **Applicability:** All phases. Critical during burnout_risk. 


* 
**Contraindications:** None. 



### CANON-MEAN-002: Purpose Reduces Inflammation Biomarkers

* 
**Doctrine:** Purpose is associated with lower CRP/IL-6 and reduced Alzheimer's risk. 


* **Mechanism:** Eudaimonic wellbeing downregulates inflammatory genes. Buffers physiological stress effects. 


* 
**Applicability:** Transition and recovery phases. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Acute mental health crisis (focus on physiological stabilization first). 



### CANON-MEAN-003: Cognitive Stimulation Is Neuroprotective

* 
**Doctrine:** Engagement with novel, demanding activities builds cognitive reserve. 


* **Mechanism:** Novel challenges stimulate BDNF and neurogenesis. Difficulty/novelty is key. 


* 
**Applicability:** Build/Optimize phases (after foundations are set). 


* 
**Contraindications:** High cognitive_load state (defer until load reduces). 



### CANON-MEAN-004: Identity Precedes Behavior Change

* 
**Doctrine:** Frame interventions as identity statements ("I am a sleeper") not tasks. 


* **Mechanism:** Identity-aligned behaviors are maintained 3-5x longer. Conflicts create cognitive dissonance. 


* 
**Applicability:** Stabilization and Transition phases. 


* 
**Contraindications:** Active identity crisis (focus on small behavioral anchors). 



### CANON-MEAN-005: Loneliness is a Quantifiable Health Risk

* 
**Doctrine:** Perceived loneliness is an active constraint equivalent to sleep debt. 


* **Mechanism:** Triggers threat response, elevates cortisol, fragments sleep. Accelerates cognitive decline. 


* 
**Applicability:** All phases. 


* 
**Contraindications:** None.
