# 5-Day Alignment Check — 2026-02-04

**Period:** 2026-01-30 to 2026-02-04 (5 days)  
**Commits Analyzed:** 77 commits  
**Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL DRIFT DETECTED

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The last 5 days focused almost entirely on infrastructure hardening (security, deployment, monitoring) with ZERO progress toward North Star (Biological Family Office). While production readiness improved from 70% → 92%, we are building a more secure content-provider, not transforming into an execution platform.**

**Key Finding:** 100% of work was AX-1 (reducing friction) and infrastructure. 0% was AX-3 (execution primacy) or revenue-generating features.

**Recommendation:** Immediately pivot to Horizon 1 features (Emergency Modes, Calendar Sync) or risk becoming a well-secured static protocol app.

## 🔬 AXIOM COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Compliance Table

| Axiom | Current | Target | Gap | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| **AX-1: Zero Cognitive Load** | 65% | 100% | -35% | 🟡 IMPROVING |
| **AX-2: Context Sovereignty** | 0% | 100% | -100% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **AX-3: Execution Primacy** | 0% | 100% | -100% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **AX-4: Discretion Protocol** | 90% | 100% | -10% | 🟢 GOOD |
| **AX-5: Biological Truth** | 0% | 100% | -100% | 🔴 CRITICAL |

### Detailed Analysis

#### AX-1: Zero Cognitive Load (65% → Target: 100%)
**Status:** 🟡 IMPROVING

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Security headers reduce user security burden
- ✅ Error monitoring (Sentry) will reduce debugging friction
- ✅ Mobile UX improvements (44px targets, numeric keyboard)
- ✅ Admin auth moved server-side (less manual checking)
- ⚠️ Still no Emergency Modes (user must manually override protocol)
- ⚠️ Still no Calendar Sync (user must manually activate modes)

**Gap:** -35%  
**Blocker:** No context-aware features implemented yet

---

#### AX-2: Context Sovereignty (0% → Target: 100%)
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Evidence:**
- ❌ No Emergency Mode Selector implemented
- ❌ No Calendar API integration
- ❌ No auto-detection of travel, sickness, or deep work
- ❌ System still delivers static 30-day protocols
- ❌ User must manually override when context changes

**Gap:** -100%  
**Blocker:** Horizon 1 features not started  
**Impact:** System violates core axiom - blind to biological state

**VISION.md Quote:**
> "When user boards a flight to Singapore or contracts influenza, the system continues recommending morning HIIT and evening blue-light exposure."

**Current Reality:** This is still happening. No progress.

---

#### AX-3: Execution Primacy (0% → Target: 100%)
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Evidence:**
- ❌ No fulfillment features implemented
- ❌ No supplement ordering
- ❌ No lab integration
- ❌ No one-click execution
- ✅ Information delivery works (plans generated)
- ❌ But information without action = noise (per AX-3)

**Gap:** -100%  
**Blocker:** Horizon 3 features (Concierge Loop) not started  
**Impact:** Still a content-provider, not Family Office

**VISION.md Quote:**
> "Only delivered outcomes count; information without action is noise"

**Current Reality:** We deliver information (30-day plans). No execution.

---

#### AX-4: Discretion Protocol (90% → Target: 100%)
**Status:** 🟢 GOOD

**Evidence:**
- ✅ No social features implemented
- ✅ No sharing mechanisms (except WhatsApp self-message)
- ✅ No community/feeds
- ✅ Admin panel hidden (server-side auth)
- ✅ Future page hidden (`/future` not linked)
- ⚠️ Beta badge visible (minor discretion leak)

**Gap:** -10%  
**Blocker:** Beta badge could be more subtle

---

#### AX-5: Biological Truth Supremacy (0% → Target: 100%)
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATION

**Evidence:**
- ❌ No wearable integration (Oura, Whoop)
- ❌ No HRV tracking
- ❌ No sleep data import
- ❌ No lab data import
- ❌ 100% manual input (age, weight, goals)
- ❌ No objective biological data used

**Gap:** -100%  
**Blocker:** Horizon 2 features (Silent Truth) not started  
**Impact:** Subjective input only, no biological truth

**VISION.md Quote:**
> "Objective data supersedes subjective input" (manual_input_ratio < 0.10)

**Current Reality:** manual_input_ratio = 1.0 (100% manual)

---

## 🎯 NORTH STAR PROGRESS

### Distance to "Biological Family Office"

**Previous Cycle:** 15% (per VISION.md)  
**Current Cycle:** 15%  
**Change:** 0% (NO PROGRESS)

### Breakdown

| Component | Weight | Previous | Current | Change |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Context Awareness (H1)** | 30% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| **Zero-Input Layer (H2)** | 30% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| **Concierge Loop (H3)** | 40% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| **Infrastructure** | - | 70% | 92% | +22% |

**Analysis:**
- Infrastructure improved significantly (70% → 92%)
- But infrastructure is NOT North Star progress
- North Star = transformation to execution platform
- 0% progress toward execution features

**Conclusion:** We are 15% toward North Star, same as 5 days ago.

## 🎯 TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Start Horizon 1 Features (This Week)
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Impact:** Massive (unlocks AX-2)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build Emergency Mode Selector UI (3-4 days)
  - 4 modes: Travel, Sick, Detox, Deep Work
  - One-tap activation
  - Protocol stack reconfiguration
- [ ] Integrate Calendar API (5-7 days)
  - Google Calendar OAuth
  - Flight detection
  - Auto-activate Travel Mode
- [ ] Test with real users (2-3 days)

**Why Critical:**
- Currently violating AX-2 (Context Sovereignty)
- 0% progress toward North Star in 5 days
- Infrastructure is ready, but no value features

**FUTURE.md Ranking:**
- Emergency Modes not in top 10 (missing!)
- Calendar Sync: Rank #7 (Score: 12, Strategic Bet)

**Recommendation:** Add Emergency Modes to FUTURE.md as Rank #1

---

### 2. HIGH: Define Horizon 1 Sprint (Next 30 Days)
**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Effort:** 1 hour planning  
**Impact:** High (prevents drift)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create 30-day sprint plan for Horizon 1
- [ ] Set milestones:
  - Week 1: Emergency Mode Selector MVP
  - Week 2: Calendar API integration
  - Week 3: Auto-detection logic
  - Week 4: User testing + iteration
- [ ] Add to tasks.md as top priority
- [ ] Block out infrastructure work (unless critical)

**Why High:**
- Need clear roadmap to avoid infrastructure drift
- Horizon 1 is 6-month timeline, already Month 0
- Risk of becoming "well-secured static app"

---

### 3. MEDIUM: Audit Feature Backlog Against Axioms
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Effort:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** Medium (prevents future drift)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Review all features in FUTURE.md
- [ ] Score each against 5 axioms
- [ ] Reject features that violate axioms
- [ ] Add Emergency Modes to ranking
- [ ] Update build sequence

**Why Medium:**
- FUTURE.md missing Emergency Modes (critical H1 feature)
- Need to ensure all features align with axioms
- Prevent building features that don't advance North Star

---

## 🔍 AXIOM VIOLATION DETAILS

- **Timeline:** 12-24 months (long-term)

**AX-5: Biological Truth (0%)**
- **Violation:** 100% manual input, no objective data
- **Impact:** Recommendations based on subjective input only
- **Friction:** Medium (inaccurate recommendations)
- **Fix:** Horizon 2 features (wearable integration)
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months (medium-term)

---

## ⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT

### Biggest Risk to Monitor
**Infrastructure Drift**

**Definition:** Continuing to build infrastructure/tooling instead of value features.

**Indicators:**
- Last 5 days: 45% infrastructure, 0% North Star features
- Production readiness improving, but North Star static
- Temptation to "just one more security feature"

**Mitigation:**
- Block infrastructure work unless critical
- Set hard deadline: No more infra after Week 2
- Focus 100% on Horizon 1 features

---

## 📋 KEY METRIC TO IMPROVE

**AX-2: Context Sovereignty**

**Current:** 0%  
**Target (30 days):** 40%  
**Target (90 days):** 80%

**Why This Metric:**
- Most critical axiom violation
- Directly impacts user experience
- Unlocks North Star progress
- Horizon 1 features address this

**How to Measure:**
- % of protocol changes triggered by context (not manual)
- Target: >40% of changes auto-triggered

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**The last 5 days were productive for infrastructure, but represent ZERO progress toward the North Star.** We are building a more secure, better-monitored content-provider, not transforming into a Biological Family Office.

**Critical Action:** Immediately pivot to Horizon 1 features (Emergency Modes, Calendar Sync) or risk permanent drift into "well-secured static protocol app" territory.

**Next Alignment Check:** 2026-02-09 (5 days)
